# PyQt6 for GUI
PyQt6>=6.4.0

# Firestore and Firebase dependencies
requests>=2.28.0

# Note: For Firestore with email/password authentication, we use Firebase REST API
# which only requires the 'requests' library. This avoids the need for
# firebase-admin and service account JSON files.

# For production, you may also want:
# - python-dotenv (for environment variables)
# - cryptography (for secure credential storage)
